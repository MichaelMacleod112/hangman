# Hangman

Hangman is a classic word game where one player thinks of a word, and the other player tries to guess it within a limited number of attempts.

## Description

This project is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer selects a word, and the user attempts to guess it.

## Installation

Developed on Python version 3.8.8

3rd party libraries required for full experience - `nltk`

## Usage

To play the game, run `milestone_5.py`.

## Project Structure

- `milestone_2.py`: A short script that requests user input and checks if it's a single alphabetical character.
- `milestone_3.py`: Builds on `milestone_2.py` to validate the user's guess against the correct answer.
- `milestone_4.py`: Combines functionality from `milestone_3` into a Hangman class.
- `milestone_5.py`: Completes Hangman classes and game functions. Allows users to choose between a short list of words and a longer word list downloaded from the nltk library. Provides the option to start a new game after completing the previous one. Additionally, it includes various messages to enhance the user experience.
